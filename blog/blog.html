          <h1 class="title">The road to self-taught software development</h1>
          <p class="quote">
            Ever since I started learning programming I wanted to document every single experience 
            for the world to see, and to share my experiences with other aspiring developers...who want to get into the field through the self-taught route (No degree)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I have the chance, some skills and the time to put into this blog, it has been one crazy journey for sure, 
            these past 3 years ever since I landed into this city again, the same city I grew up and made most of 
            my memories.Before I was even ready to get into my first development job (barely some html,css,bootstrap and not even basic understanding of js) somehow the opportunity appeared
            and took it with no hesitation.This is a journey of never-ending learning.
            Make no mistake, moving forward into the field was not easy.Software engineering is no joke...
          </p>
          <p>
            ...and it happened, prior to this opportunity I was doing all kinds of jobs, customer service, technical sales,timeshare sales, translating over-the-phone.Any way to discover what I wanted to do with my life, 
            and then I stumbled upon this Youtube Channel, which inspired me to get started coding seriously....during that time I didn't stop to think about it, if it was a difficult field, what kind of crazy hours you'd have to stick to..
